# MusicTheoryInC

This music theory project in C demonstrates several valuable skills:

- Domain Knowledge Translation: Taking music theory concepts and implementing them programmatically demonstrates an ability to translate real-world problems into code
- Feature Planning: The clear tracking of completed and planned features in ideas.md demonstrates project management skills
- Test-Driven Approach: TODO...
- Algorithm Implementation: Building scale and chord generators requires specific logic and mathematical thinking
- Containerization: The project is containerized using Docker, showcasing familiarity with modern development practices
- Input Validation: Implemented error handling for user inputs, showing attention to edge cases
- Modular Design: Breaking down music theory concepts into discrete functions shows good software design principles
- State Management: The project handles user input and maintains program state, which is a fundamental programming concept

This projects approaches music theory concepts as a way to practice and demonstrate programming skills while also
leaning into my personal interests as a life-long musician.
